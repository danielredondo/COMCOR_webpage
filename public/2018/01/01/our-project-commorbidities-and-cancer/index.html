<h2 id="the-impact-of-comorbidities-on-cancer-prognosis-and-survival-a-population-based-evaluation">The impact of comorbidities on Cancer Prognosis and Survival: a Population-Based Evaluation</h2>

<p>Recurrence and disease-free survival are usually analysed in clinical trials, enrolling healthier and younger cancer patients than the general cancer population, thus being unrepresentative for the real-world where comorbid elderly cancer patients are the group with higher cancer incidence rates. As part of the effort to evaluate real-world comparative effectiveness research and cancer survival outcomes, the cancer registries of Granada and Girona, identified all incident cases (n = 4,678) from five different cancer sites. Clinical information from patients diagnosed during the period 2010-2012 and follow-up until December 31st, 2016 was collected as part of a High-Resolution study (2013-Transcan project). Patients’ age at diagnosis, tumour stage, bio-molecular tumour characteristics, type of treatment and commorbidities were drawn from administrative and medical records.</p>

<p>The main objective of the proposal is to <strong>investigate the extent to which comorbidities influence cancer prognosis, survival, and treatment choices</strong>. We will analyse 1, 2, 3, and 5-year progression free survival, and overall survival of patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and lung cancers, skin melanoma and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Specifically, we will investigate:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the response to the first treatment, and progression free survival after at least five years since diagnosis</p></li>

<li><p>the extent to which the presence of commorbidities is associated with clinical adherence to cancer treatment guidelines</p></li>

<li><p>the occurrence and type of the relapse</p></li>

<li><p>the association of cancer progression with patients’ and tumour characteristics, type of treatment and commorbidities.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The investigation will contribute to promote policy action aiming to reduce cancer survival disparities.</strong></p>
