## The impact of comorbidities on Cancer Prognosis and Survival: a Population-Based Evaluation

Recurrence and disease-free survival are usually analysed in clinical trials, enrolling healthier and younger cancer patients than the general cancer population, thus being unrepresentative for the real-world where comorbid elderly cancer patients are the group with higher cancer incidence rates. As part of the effort to evaluate real-world comparative effectiveness research and cancer survival outcomes, the cancer registries of Granada and Girona, identified all incident cases (n = 4,678) from five different cancer sites. Clinical information from patients diagnosed during the period 2010-2012 and follow-up until December 31st, 2016 was collected as part of a High-Resolution study (2013-Transcan project). Patients’ age at diagnosis, tumour stage, bio-molecular tumour characteristics, type of treatment and comorbidities were drawn from administrative and medical records.

The main objective of the proposal is to **investigate the extent to which comorbidities influence cancer prognosis, survival, and treatment choices**. We will analyse 1, 2, 3, and 5-year progression free survival, and overall survival of patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and lung cancers, skin melanoma and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Specifically, we will investigate:

- the response to the first treatment, and progression free survival after at least five years since diagnosis

- the extent to which the presence of comorbidities is associated with clinical adherence to cancer treatment guidelines

- the occurrence and type of the relapse

- the association of cancer progression with patients’ and tumour characteristics, type of treatment and comorbidities.

**The investigation will contribute to promote policy action aiming to reduce cancer survival disparities.**
