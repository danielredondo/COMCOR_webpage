## Abstract

Cancer recurrence and disease-free survival are usually analysed in clinical trials. Cancer clinical trials usually enroll healthier and younger patients than the general cancer population. Therefore, cancer clinical trials population is unrepresentative for the real-world where comorbid elderly patients are the group with higher cancer incidence rates.

As part of the effort to evaluate real-world comparative effectiveness research and cancer survival outcomes, the population-based cancer registries of Granada and Girona identified all incident cases (n=1,061) from colorectal cancer patients. Detailed clinical information was collected from medical records as part of a High-Resolution European study (HIGHCARE project-Eranet TRANSCAN). The clinical information included patients and tumour characteristics, type of treatment and comorbidities status. Patients were followed until the end of December 2016 to assess their vital status.

CoMCoR project identified a consistent pattern of factors associated with a higher prevalence of comorbidities and multimorbidity at diagnosis and an increased time-to-surgery among patients with colorectal cancer with multimorbidity in Spain. This pattern may provide insights for further etiological and preventive research and help to identify patients at a higher risk for poorer cancer outcomes and suboptimal treatment. 

Furthermore, we found that multimorbidity was a strong independent predictor of short-term mortality at 6 months and 1 year among the colorectal cancer patients. The identified multimorbidity pattern was consistent. 

CoMCoR findings might help identify patients at a higher risk for poor cancer and treatment outcomes.
