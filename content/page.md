## Background and objectives

Cancer recurrence and disease-free survival are usually analysed in clinical trials, enrolling healthier and younger patients than the general cancer population, thus being unrepresentative for the real-world where comorbid elderly patients are the group with higher cancer incidence rates. As part of the effort to evaluate real-world comparative effectiveness research and cancer survival outcomes, the population-based cancer registries of Granada and Girona identified all incident cases (n=1,061) from colorectal cancer patients. Clinical information from patients diagnosed during the year 2011 and follow-up until December 31st, 2016, was collected as part of a High-Resolution European study (HIGHCARE project-Eranet TRANSCAN). Patients and tumour characteristics, type of treatment, and comorbidities were drawn from medical records.  

The main objective of the proposal is to **describe the pattern of comorbidities** by patient, tumour and healthcare factors and **to investigate** the extent to which comorbidities influence **time from diagnosis to cancer surgical treatment** and **cancer treatment**. 

-  We will describe 12 different chronic conditions based on the UK Royal College of Surgeons Charlson modified comorbidity score by patient’s, tumour and healthcare factors.  

-  To characterize the frequency and distribution of comorbidities among colorectal patients we will use advanced visualization tools, such as interactive radar plots and heat maps.  

-  Then, we will analyse the impact of comorbidities on cancer treatment and time-to-surgery from colorectal cancer patients, adjusted for patients’ and tumour characteristics, and type of treatment.   

-  Finally, we will develop a web application to disseminate the results of the project and contribute promoting policy action aiming to reduce survival disparities among colorectal cancer patients affected by comorbidities.  

**The investigation will contribute to promote policy action aiming to reduce cancer survival disparities.**
